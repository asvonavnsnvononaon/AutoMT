# AutoMT: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems

Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can have severe consequences. Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS, but existing methods rely heavily on human effort and are hard to automate in industrial pipelines. We present \tool, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic rules and generates valid follow-up test cases. \tool\ uses LLMs to extract scenario ontologies and define MRs in Gherkin syntax. A vision-language agent analyzes each scenario, while a search agent retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up test cases. \tool\ can apply advanced computer vision techniques for MT on real-world datasets or perform MT directly in simulation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that \tool\ generates valid MRs and outperforms baselines by up to \tochecklf{28.26\%} in generating valid follow-up test and \tochecklf{19.28\%} in violation detection. \tool\ enables fully automated MT for ADS and can be integrated as a plug-in leveraging local traffic rules and existing test cases in industrial pipelines.
